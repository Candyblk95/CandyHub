# 🍬 CandyHub

**Everything I make, play with, obsess over, mod, tweak, break, and rebuild — all in one deliciously curated place.**

This is my digital playground: a hub for my Sims setups, CC & mod libraries, cluttercore builds, video projects, cursed experiments, and anything else I’m currently fixated on. If you've ever watched one of my videos or streams and whispered “what CC is that?” or “how do I get my game like that?” …welcome home, babe.

## ✨ What’s Inside (aka The Good Stuff)

- **Mod & CC Library** — My entire Sims loadout, linked to original creators like the good girl I am
- **Build & CAS Resources** — Clutter sets, packs, looks, and presets I use to make everything extra
- **Videos & Projects** — Builds, CAS, challenges, RP nonsense, and cozy chaos
- **Creator Portfolio** — Who I am, what I make, how I play, and where to find me
- **Future Shenanigans** — Tools, guides, downloads, and other surprises once I finish breaking things

## 🎮 Current Game Roster

Right now I’m creating content for:

- **The Sims 4** — Mods, CC, builds, presets, CAS, and gameplay chaos
- **Animal Crossing** — Gothic fairycore island energy + dream tours
- **World of Warcraft** — UI setups, weak auras, and Moonlit elf vibes
- **GTA RP** — Characters, businesses, lore, outfits, screenshots, and drama™

*(I am multi-fandom and easily influenced, expect additions.)*

## 💖 The Candy Aesthetic

- Maxis match, cluttercore, celestial witch energy
- Pink & black (obviously)
- Cozy but modded to filth
- Pretty, curated, functional, and unapologetically extra

## 📝 Mod Etiquette

I link everything to **original creators**.  
Support them. They’re the reason our games look feral and gorgeous.

I don’t reupload or redistribute CC or mods — this hub exists so you can download directly from the source and keep creators credited and fed.

## 🚧 Under Construction (aka Under Renovation)

CandyHub is actively being built, reorganized, re-styled, and expanded.  
Expect updates, new pages, and a suspicious amount of pink.
